# Algonimation 

Welcome to **Algonimation**, an interactive webpage designed to bring algorithms to life! This project is dedicated to creating animations for various algorithms, starting with sorting algorithms like **Bubble Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and others. My aim is to build a visual learning platform to help understand algorithms Iâ€™ll encounter in my future studies.

This is my first webpage project, built with **Angular 17**, deployed on **Netlify**, and powered by **Chart.js** for graphical representations and **Prism.js** for code block styling.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Algonimation aims to make learning algorithms more engaging through animations and visual aids. It currently focuses on sorting algorithms, and I plan to add more algorithm visualizations over time. 

## Project Architecture
The project follows Angular's best practices, using components, services, and routing. The structure is designed to be scalable, ensuring that more features and algorithms can be added over time. The separation of concerns is maintained through Angular's modularity and component communication via observables and pipes.

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Optimizing the page for performance and use animation to describe what an algorithm does.
- **Solution**: Implemented lazy loading, dynamic code splitting, and performance testing using Angular tools.

## Accessibility
- Added ARIA labels and ensured keyboard navigation support for a better experience for screen reader users.

## Future Improvements / Roadmap
- Expand the algorithm animations with more complex algorithms (e.g., searching algorithms, graph algorithms).
- Improve mobile responsiveness for smaller screens.
- Integrate real-time collaborative features for learning.

## ðŸŒ± What I Learned

This project was an incredible learning experience in Angular and web development as a whole. Here are some of the skills and knowledge I gained during this journey:

- **Angular Fundamentals**: Learned how to create a structured Angular project from scratch, including the creation and organization of components, and communicating between them using pipes and observables.
- **Webpage Structuring & SEO**: Gained a foundational understanding of webpage structure and best practices to improve SEO and make the page more discoverable on search engines.
- **Testing**: Explored how to write tests to ensure that each component functions correctly and reliably.
- **Theming & Angular Material**: Used Angular Material extensively and learned to create different themes, including a dark mode toggle, to enhance the user experience.
- **Algorithms**: Deepened my understanding of various sorting algorithms and developed the skills to visualize them.
- **HTML, CSS, and TypeScript**: Strengthened my knowledge in these core web technologies, which are essential for building modern web applications.
