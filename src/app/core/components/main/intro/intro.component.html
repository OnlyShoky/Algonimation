        <p>
          <strong>Data Structures</strong> is about how data can be stored in
          different structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Algorithms</strong> is about how to solve different problems,
          often by searching through and manipulating data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Theory about Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) helps us to use
          large amounts of data to solve problems efficiently.

      <h5 matSubheader>What are Data Structures?</h5>
      <p>A data structure is a way to store data.</p>
      <p>
        We structure data in different ways depending on what data we have, and
        what we want to do with it.

      <mat-card class="note">
        <p>
          <strong>Primitive Data Structures:</strong> Single-value structures,
          e.g., integers, booleans.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Abstract Data Structures:</strong> Higher-level structures
          like arrays, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
        </p>
      </mat-card>

      <h5 matSubheader>What are Algorithms?</h5>
      <p>
        An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions to solve a given
        problem or achieve a specific goal.
